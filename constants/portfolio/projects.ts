    prompt: `Create a reusable **Holographic Referral Card** component for an existing React + TypeScript codebase.

Goal:
Build a premium interactive referral/invite card with a dark physical-card look, soft holographic glow, pointer-tracked 3D tilt, and a central invite artwork area. The component should feel like a polished design-engineering portfolio component: tactile, minimal, responsive, and easy to drop into another codebase.

Component behavior:

* The card should tilt in 3D based on pointer position.
* Pointer movement should update:

  * \`rotateX\`
  * \`rotateY\`
  * \`translateZ\`
  * a radial glow position
  * glow opacity
* On pointer enter, the card should lift slightly using \`translateZ\`.
* On pointer leave, the card should smoothly reset to its neutral state.
* Touch input should not trigger the pointer-following animation.
* Keyboard focus should reveal the glow subtly.
* Blur should reset the card state.
* The glow should follow the pointer using a radial gradient and \`mix-blend-overlay\`.

Visual design:

* Outer wrapper should have a fixed responsive max width around \`375px\`.
* Inner card should use:

  * dark charcoal background
  * rounded corners
  * deep stacked shadow
  * subtle desaturated/saturated card feel
  * generous padding
* Header area:

  * left logo/avatar
  * right optional secondary logo or link
* Main media area:

  * vertical \`3/4\` aspect ratio
  * rounded image container
  * background image fills the card using \`object-cover\`
  * central white discount/check-style icon overlay
* Footer area:

  * left title text
  * right muted description/handle text
  * both should truncate if long
* Final visual layer:

  * absolute radial glow overlay
  * hidden from screen readers
  * pointer-events disabled

Technical requirements:

* Use React + TypeScript.
* Use Motion for React from \`motion/react\`.
* Use:

  * \`motion\`
  * \`useMotionValue\`
  * \`useSpring\`
  * \`useMotionTemplate\`
  * \`useReducedMotion\`
* Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
* Use a \`cn()\` utility for class merging.
* The component must be a client component with \`"use client"\`.
* Do not use external 3D libraries.
* Do not use JavaScript animation loops.
* Keep the component fully reusable through props.

Expected props:

\`\`\`tsx
export type CardLogo =
  | React.ReactNode
  | {
      src: string
      alt: string
      className?: string
    }

export type HolographicReferralCardProps = {
  image?: string
  imageAlt?: string
  title?: string
  description?: string
  logo?: CardLogo
  logoAlt?: string
  secondLogo?: CardLogo
  secondLogoAlt?: string
  secondLogoHref?: string
  secondLogoAriaLabel?: string
  ariaLabel?: string
  className?: string
}
\`\`\`

Expected usage:

\`\`\`tsx
<HolographicReferralCard
  image="/logo.png"
  imageAlt="Invite background"
  title="Comet"
  description="#diip3sh"
  logo={{ src: "/logo.svg", alt: "Comet avatar" }}
  secondLogo="/x.svg"
  secondLogoAlt="X logo"
  secondLogoHref="https://x.com/diip3sh"
/>
\`\`\`

Motion details:

* Use spring options similar to:

\`\`\`ts
const springOptions = {
  stiffness: 260,
  damping: 28,
  mass: 0.7,
}
\`\`\`

* Calculate pointer progress from the card bounds:

\`\`\`ts
const xProgress = pointerX / bounds.width
const yProgress = pointerY / bounds.height
\`\`\`

* Use these formulas for tilt:

\`\`\`ts
rotateX.set((yProgress - 0.5) * 20)
rotateY.set((xProgress - 0.5) * -20)
translateZ.set(20)
\`\`\`

* Use a transform template like:

\`\`\`ts
perspective(1000px) rotateX(...) rotateY(...) translateZ(...)
\`\`\`

* Use a glow background like:

\`\`\`ts
radial-gradient(circle at X% Y%, rgba(255,255,255,0.9) 10%, rgba(255,255,255,0.75) 20%, rgba(255,255,255,0) 80%)
\`\`\`

Accessibility:

* Respect \`prefers-reduced-motion\`.
* If reduced motion is enabled, disable the 3D transform but keep the card usable.
* The decorative glow layer must use \`aria-hidden="true"\`.
* The central icon should be decorative unless it communicates meaningful status.
* If the secondary logo is clickable, render it as an accessible anchor with:

  * \`aria-label\`
  * visible focus ring
  * \`target="_blank"\`
  * \`rel="noreferrer"\`
* Use semantic HTML, preferably \`article\`, with an \`aria-label\`.

Implementation requirements:
Return the full code for:

1. \`HolographicReferralCard.tsx\`
2. Any helper types/functions inside the same file
3. The inline SVG discount/check icon
4. Example usage
5. A short customization note explaining how to change image, logos, title, description, shadows, tilt strength, and glow intensity

Do not simplify the interaction into a static card. The final result must include the pointer-tracked 3D tilt and holographic radial glow.`,

    prompt: `Create a reusable **Scroll Morph Bento Grid** component for an existing React + TypeScript codebase.

      Goal:
      Build a scroll-driven animation where large text fragments transform into a polished image bento grid. The component should feel like a premium landing-page interaction: cinematic, editorial, smooth, and portfolio-grade.

      The effect:

      * The section starts as oversized text fragments arranged across a large canvas.
      * Each important word has a matching bento card.
      * On scroll, each word/card transitions from its original inline text position into a final bento-grid layout.
      * During the transition:

        * the card moves from a source rectangle into its final bento rectangle
        * the card expands in width and height
        * border radius changes slightly
        * a clipped image-text layer appears
        * text scales up
        * the image fades in
        * the final overlay/title layer fades in
      * The final state should be a multi-card bento grid with image backgrounds and large typography.

      Stack:

      * React
      * TypeScript
      * Tailwind CSS
      * Motion for React from \`motion/react\`

      Use these Motion APIs:

      * \`motion\`
      * \`useScroll\`
      * \`useTransform\`
      * \`useReducedMotion\`
      * \`MotionValue\`

      Do not use:

      * GSAP
      * canvas
      * WebGL
      * external animation libraries other than Motion
      * JavaScript animation loops

      Component structure:
      Create these pieces:

      1. \`Rect\` type:

      \`\`\`ts
      type Rect = {
        x: number
        y: number
        width: number
        height: number
      }
      \`\`\`

      2. \`BentoItem\` type:

      \`\`\`ts
      type BentoItem = {
        index: number
        text: string
        agent?: string
        source: Rect
        bento: Rect
        imageSrc: string
        imagePosition: string
        isInitiallyClipped?: boolean
        variant?: "large" | "regular"
        foreground?: {
          text: string
          className: string
        }
        title: {
          text: string
          className: string
        }
        message?: string
      }
      \`\`\`

      3. \`BentoGridCard\` component:

      * Receives:

      \`\`\`ts
      {
        item: BentoItem
        progress: MotionValue<number>
      }
      \`\`\`

      * Uses \`useTransform\` to animate:

        * \`left\`
        * \`top\`
        * \`width\`
        * \`height\`
        * \`borderRadius\`
        * \`borderColor\`
        * white text opacity
        * clipped text opacity
        * text scale
        * image opacity
        * image scale
        * overlay opacity

      4. \`PlainText\` component:

      * Receives:

      \`\`\`ts
      {
        children: React.ReactNode
        progress: MotionValue<number>
        rect: Rect
      }
      \`\`\`

      * Renders large plain text at an absolute position.
      * Fades out as the bento transition begins.

      5. Main \`ScrollMorphBentoGrid\` component:

      * Uses a tall scroll section.
      * Uses a sticky viewport.
      * Uses \`useScroll\` with:

      \`\`\`ts
      offset: ["start start", "end end"]
      \`\`\`

      * Centers a large internal animation canvas.
      * Maps over the bento item data to render each animated card.
      * Renders additional plain text fragments between the cards.

      Animation constants:
      Use a transition range similar to:

      \`\`\`ts
      const BENTO_START = 0.76
      const BENTO_END = 1
      \`\`\`

      The scroll section should be tall enough to allow a slow cinematic transition:

      \`\`\`tsx
      <section className="relative h-[620vh] bg-white">
      \`\`\`

      The sticky viewport should fill the screen:

      \`\`\`tsx
      <div className="sticky top-0 flex h-screen items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-white p-6">
      \`\`\`

      Use a large internal canvas so the animation can be precisely positioned:

      \`\`\`tsx
      <div className="absolute left-1/2 top-1/2 h-[1120px] w-[1560px] -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-[35%] scale-[min(1,calc((100vw-48px)/1560))]">
      \`\`\`

      Card animation behavior:

      * Each card should start from its \`source\` rectangle.
      * Each card should end at its \`bento\` rectangle.
      * \`source\` represents where the original word appears in the sentence.
      * \`bento\` represents the final card location in the grid.

      Use transforms like:

      \`\`\`ts
      const left = useTransform(progress, [BENTO_START, BENTO_END], [item.source.x, item.bento.x])
      const top = useTransform(progress, [BENTO_START, BENTO_END], [item.source.y, item.bento.y])
      const width = useTransform(progress, [BENTO_START, BENTO_END], [item.source.width, item.bento.width])
      const height = useTransform(progress, [BENTO_START, BENTO_END], [item.source.height, item.bento.height])
      \`\`\`

      Text/image reveal behavior:

      * Each card should have two text layers:

        1. a normal visible text layer
        2. a clipped image-text layer using \`bg-clip-text\` and \`text-transparent\`
      * The clipped text should use the same image as the card background.
      * The clipped text should appear before the image fully reveals.
      * The image should fade in after the text expansion begins.
      * The final title/overlay layer should fade in near the end of the scroll.

      Card visual style:

      * Absolute positioned cards.
      * White card base.
      * Rounded corners.
      * Overflow hidden.
      * Border around the card.
      * Image background uses \`backgroundImage\`, \`backgroundPosition\`, and \`backgroundSize: cover\`.
      * Add a subtle overlay gradient on top of the image in the final state.
      * Final card titles should use large expressive typography.

      Accessibility:

      * Respect \`prefers-reduced-motion\`.
      * If reduced motion is enabled:

        * render the final bento grid state
        * avoid scroll-linked morphing
        * avoid scaling/opacity choreography
      * Decorative image layers should be \`aria-hidden="true"\`.
      * Use a descriptive \`aria-label\` on the section.
      * The layout should remain visually understandable without animation.

      Data example:
      Use a data-driven array of bento items. Include at least 5 cards:

      * Notes
      * Memories
      * Vision
      * Contacts
      * Messages

      Each item should define:

      * source rectangle
      * final bento rectangle
      * text fragment
      * image source
      * image position
      * title styling
      * optional foreground label
      * optional message text

      Expected usage:

      \`\`\`tsx
      <ScrollMorphBentoGrid />
      \`\`\`

      Return:

      1. Full \`ScrollMorphBentoGrid.tsx\` code.
      2. The \`Rect\` and \`BentoItem\` types.
      3. The \`BentoGridCard\` component.
      4. The \`PlainText\` component.
      5. A sample \`bentoItems\` array.
      6. Example usage in a Next.js page.
      7. Short notes explaining how to customize:

         * card positions
         * source text positions
         * images
         * scroll duration
         * transition timing
         * typography
         * reduced-motion behavior

      Important:
      Do not turn this into a static grid. The key interaction is the scroll-linked morph from text fragments into final image bento cards.

      'Create a reusable **Paper Shred Delete Button** component for an existing React + TypeScript codebase.\n\nBefore writing any code, ask me this clarification question and wait for my answer:\n\n**How should reset functionality be handled after the shred animation completes?**\n\nOffer these options:\n\n1. Show a visible **Reset** button below the shred interaction.\n2. Auto-reset after a short delay, for example 2-3 seconds.\n3. Expose a controlled reset API through props, so the parent component controls when the button resets.\n4. Do not reset automatically; keep the component in the shredded state.\n5. Suggest the best reset behavior based on the use case.\n\nDo not start implementation until I choose one of these reset behaviors.\n\nGoal:\nBuild a polished destructive-action micro-interaction where hovering or focusing a red delete button previews a document above it, and clicking the button animates the document being shredded into paper strips.\n\nThe component should feel tactile, playful, precise, and production-ready.\n\nComponent concept:\n\n* A red “Delete” button sits inside a small relative-positioned stage.\n* On hover or keyboard focus:\n\n  * the button slightly scales up\n  * the button lifts upward\n  * the trash icon rotates and scales\n  * a white document appears above the button\n* On click:\n\n  * the document visually shreds\n  * the document disappears using `clip-path`\n  * SVG paper strips draw in below the button\n  * the button becomes disabled while shredding\n* After shredding completes:\n\n  * handle the reset behavior based on my answer to the reset question\n\nState machine:\nUse this state model:\n\n```ts\ntype ShredState = "idle" | "preview" | "shredding" | "shredded"\n```\n\nState behavior:\n\n* `idle`\n\n  * button is normal\n  * document is hidden\n  * shredded strips are hidden\n* `preview`\n\n  * document appears above the button\n  * button has hover/focus emphasis\n  * icon rotates and scales\n* `shredding`\n\n  * document clips away\n  * shredded SVG paths draw in\n  * delete button is disabled\n* `shredded`\n\n  * document is hidden\n  * shredded strips remain visible\n  * reset behavior depends on the option I choose\n\nStack:\n\n* React\n* TypeScript\n* Tailwind CSS\n* Motion for React from `motion/react`\n\nUse:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Transition, Variants } from "motion/react"\nimport { motion, useReducedMotion } from "motion/react"\n```\n\nTechnical requirements:\n\n* Make it a client component with `"use client"`.\n* Use Motion variants for the button, icon, document, and shredded SVG.\n* Use `useState` for the shred state.\n* Use `useRef` to store the shred completion timeout.\n* Use `useEffect` cleanup to clear the timeout on unmount.\n* Use `useCallback` for interaction handlers.\n* Use `useMemo` for generated variants/transitions that depend on reduced motion.\n* Use Tailwind CSS for styling.\n* Use a `cn()` utility for class merging.\n* Keep the component self-contained and easy to paste into a Next.js or React app.\n\nDo not use:\n\n* GSAP\n* canvas\n* WebGL\n* external animation libraries other than Motion\n* real delete/destructive business logic\n* global CSS unless required\n\nButton behavior:\n\n* Render a `motion.button`.\n* Button text should default to `Delete`.\n* Include a trash/delete icon as an inline SVG.\n* Button should respond to:\n\n  * `onHoverStart`\n  * `onHoverEnd`\n  * `onFocus`\n  * `onBlur`\n  * `onClick`\n* Hover/focus should only move from `idle` to `preview`.\n* Leaving hover/blur should only move from `preview` back to `idle`.\n* Click should only work when state is `idle` or `preview`.\n* Button should be disabled during `shredding`.\n* Whether it stays disabled in `shredded` depends on the chosen reset behavior.\n\nButton visual design:\n\n* Red destructive button.\n* Rounded-xl shape.\n* White text.\n* Thick tactile border treatment:\n\n  * left/right/top border around 2px\n  * bottom border around 4px\n* On active press, reduce bottom border thickness to feel pressed.\n* Add hover color shift from red to deeper red.\n* Add a subtle red shadow in preview state.\n* Include focus-visible ring styles.\n\nButton variants:\nUse variants similar to:\n\n```ts\nconst buttonVariants: Variants = {\n  idle: {\n    x: "-50%",\n    scale: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    boxShadow: "0px 0px 0px rgba(3,7,18,0)",\n  },\n  preview: {\n    x: "-50%",\n    scale: 1.03,\n    y: -2,\n    boxShadow: "0px 8px 18px rgba(153,27,27,.18)",\n  },\n  shredding: {\n    x: "-50%",\n    scale: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    boxShadow: "0px

with `aria-hidden="true"`.\n* In preview, rotate slightly and scale up.\n* In shredding, keep a smaller rotated/scaled state.\n* In idle/shredded, reset to normal.\n\nDocument behavior:\n\n* Render a white document rectangle above the button.\n* It should be non-interactive with `pointer-events-none`.\n* It should have:\n\n  * fixed width and height\n  * subtle border\n  * white background\n  * light drop shadow\n* In `idle`, it is hidden and slightly lower/smaller.\n* In `preview`, it becomes visible and moves into place.\n* In `shredding`, it disappears using:\n\n```ts\nclipPath: "inset(100% 0% 0% 0%)"\n```\n\n* In `shredded`, it stays hidden.\n\nShredded strips:\n\n* Render shredded paper as an SVG positioned below the button.\n* Use multiple `motion.path` elements.\n* Each path should animate with:\n\n  * `pathLength`\n  * `opacity`\n  * `y`\n* Paths should stagger slightly by index.\n* Use `custom={index}` to drive staggered variants.\n* Use thick rounded strokes to look like torn paper strips.\n* The strips should appear during `shredding` and remain visible in `shredded`.\n\nTiming:\n\n* Default shred completion delay should be around `1500ms`.\n* Reduced-motion completion delay should be around `120ms`.\n* Document shredding transition should be around `1.15s` with this easing:\n\n```ts\n{ duration: 1.15, ease: [0.65, 0, 0.35, 1] }\n```\n\nReduced motion:\nRespect `prefers-reduced-motion`.\n\nIf reduced motion is enabled:\n\n* use near-instant transitions\n* avoid long path drawing\n* shorten the shred completion delay\n* preserve the meaning of the state change\n\nAccessibility:\n\n* The section should have an accessible label:\n\n```tsx\n<section aria-label="Shred document button demo">\n```\n\n* The delete button should have:\n\n```tsx\naria-label="Shred document"\n```\n\n* Decorative SVGs should use:\n\n```tsx\naria-hidden="true"\nfocusable="false"\n```\n\n* Hover and focus states should match.\n* Disabled states should be visually clear.\n* The reset behavior must remain keyboard accessible.\n\nLayout:\n\n* Center the demo inside its parent container.\n* Use a fixed-size relative stage around `240px` wide and `368px` tall.\n* Position the document above the button.\n* Position the button in the center.\n* Position the shredded SVG below the button.\n* If I choose a visible reset button, place it below the stage.\n\nExpected usage:\n\n```tsx\n<PaperShredButton />\n```\n\nReturn only after I answer the reset clarification question:\n\n1. Full `PaperShredButton.tsx` code.\n2. The `ShredState` type.\n3. Motion variants for button, icon, document, and shredded SVG.\n4. The shredded path data array.\n5. Helper functions for transitions and path variants.\n6. The selected reset implementation.\n7. Reduced-motion support.\n8. Short customization notes for:\n\n   * button label\n   * colors\n   * shred duration\n   * document size\n   * reset behavior\n   * disabled behavior\n\nImportant:\nDo not make this a normal delete button. The key interaction is the hover/focus document preview followed by a click-triggered shredding animation.',

    prompt: `Create a reusable **Polaroid Fan Stack** component for an existing React + TypeScript codebase.

Goal:
Build a polished photo-card stack where multiple Polaroid-style cards sit stacked in the center, then fan outward into a wide arc when the user hovers the component. The interaction should feel simple, tactile, editorial, and portfolio-grade.

Component concept:

* Render 7 portrait photo cards.
* In the idle state, all cards are stacked in the center.
* Each card has the same base size, border, rounded corners, and Polaroid-style white frame.
* On hover over the parent container:

  * the cards rotate outward from left to right
  * the stack opens like a hand of cards
  * the middle card stays close to \`0deg\`
  * side cards rotate progressively outward
* Each individual card should slightly scale up on hover.

Stack:

* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* \`cn()\` utility for class merging

Do not use:

* Motion/Framer Motion
* GSAP
* Canvas
* WebGL
* JavaScript animation state
* external carousel/card libraries

Component name:

\`\`\`tsx
export const PolaroidStack = () => {
  return (...)
}
\`\`\`

Expected usage:

\`\`\`tsx
<PolaroidStack />
\`\`\`

Data structure:
Create a typed photo-card data array:

\`\`\`ts
type FanCard = {
  src: string
  alt: string
  hoverClassName: string
}
\`\`\`

Use a \`fanCards\` array with 7 cards.

Each card should include:

* \`src\`
* \`alt\`
* \`hoverClassName\`

The \`hoverClassName\` should define each card’s final rotation on parent hover.

Example hover rotations:

\`\`\`ts
-54deg
-36deg
-18deg
0deg
18deg
36deg
54deg
\`\`\`

Layout:

* The section should be full width.
* Height should be around \`560px\`.
* Center the stack horizontally and vertically.
* Hide overflow so the fanned cards stay clean inside the section.
* Use an accessible section label:

\`\`\`tsx
<section aria-label="Fanned photo cards">
\`\`\`

Parent wrapper:

* Use a \`group\` class on the parent wrapper.
* The parent should fill the section.
* The hover state should be driven by \`group-hover\`.

Card base styling:
Each card should be absolutely positioned in the center:

\`\`\`tsx
"absolute top-1/2 left-1/2"
"-translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2"
\`\`\`

Card size:

* height around \`226px\`
* width around \`152px\`

Polaroid frame:

* rounded corners around \`8%\`
* white border around \`5px\`
* larger bottom border around \`40px\`
* light gray card background

Transform origin:
Use bottom-left transform origin so the fan motion feels like the cards are pivoting from one shared hand-held point:

\`\`\`tsx
"origin-bottom-left"
\`\`\`

Idle transform:
Cards should start stacked with a slight upward translation:

\`\`\`css
rotate(0deg) translate(0px, -8px)
\`\`\`

Hover transforms:
Each card should receive a different \`group-hover\` transform.

Examples:

\`\`\`tsx
"group-hover:[transform:rotate(-54deg)_translate(0px,-8px)]"
"group-hover:[transform:rotate(-36deg)_translate(0px,-8px)]"
"group-hover:[transform:rotate(-18deg)_translate(0px,-8px)]"
"group-hover:[transform:rotate(0deg)_translate(0px,-8px)]"
"group-hover:[transform:rotate(18deg)_translate(0px,-8px)]"
"group-hover:[transform:rotate(36deg)_translate(0px,-8px)]"
"group-hover:[transform:rotate(54deg)_translate(0px,-8px)]"
\`\`\`

Card hover:
Each individual card should scale up slightly on hover:

\`\`\`tsx
"hover:[scale:1.1]"
\`\`\`

Animation:

* Use Tailwind transition classes.
* Duration should be around \`200ms\`.
* Keep the interaction quick and snappy.
* Do not use JavaScript state for the animation.

Image behavior:

* Each image should fill the card.
* Use \`object-cover\`.
* Use \`loading="lazy"\`.
* Use \`draggable={false}\` so the images do not accidentally drag during interaction.
* Each image must have a meaningful \`alt\`.

Example image element:

\`\`\`tsx
<img
  className="h-full w-full object-cover"
  draggable={false}
  loading="lazy"
  src={src}
  alt={alt}
/>
\`\`\`

Accessibility:

* Use a semantic \`section\`.
* Add \`aria-label="Fanned photo cards"\`.
* Every image should have descriptive alt text.
* Do not make cards keyboard-focusable unless they are clickable.
* If cards become links later, use real anchor tags and visible focus states.
* The hover fan effect should be decorative, not required to understand the content.

Implementation requirements:
Return:

1. Full \`PolaroidStack.tsx\` component.
2. \`FanCard\` type.
3. Shared \`cardClassName\`.
4. \`fanCards\` data array.
5. Final JSX mapping over the card data.
6. Short customization notes explaining how to change:

   * number of cards
   * card size
   * fan angle
   * transition duration
   * image sources
   * border thickness
   * Polaroid frame size
   * scale-on-hover amount

Important:
Do not turn this into a carousel. The key interaction is a centered stack that fans outward on parent hover using CSS transforms and Tailwind \`group-hover\`.`,

    prompt: `Create a reusable **Scan Document Button** component for an existing React + TypeScript codebase.

Before writing any code, ask me this clarification question and wait for my answer:

**How should the component behave after the scan reaches the “Done” state?**

Offer these options:

1. Keep it in the \`Done\` state and keep the button disabled.
2. Auto-reset back to \`Scan\` after a short delay.
3. Show a visible **Reset** button after scanning completes.
4. Expose an \`onComplete\` callback so the parent component decides what happens next.
5. Make it controlled with \`status\` and \`onStatusChange\` props.
6. Suggest the best behavior based on whether this is a demo component or a real product action.

Do not start implementation until I choose one of these completion/reset behaviors.

Goal:
Build a polished document-scanning micro-interaction where clicking a button starts a scanner animation. A document appears above the button, unfolds into view, rotates around the Y axis like a physical paper flip, and a glowing scan bar travels down and back across the document.

The component should feel precise, tactile, and portfolio-grade.

Component concept:

* Initial state shows a button labeled \`Scan\`.
* Clicking the button starts the scanning animation.
* While scanning:

  * button label changes to \`Scanning\`
  * button becomes disabled
  * document appears above the button
  * document scales open from the bottom
  * document rotates in 3D around the Y axis
  * scan bar travels vertically across the document
* When the scan completes:

  * button label changes to \`Done\`
  * post-scan behavior depends on my answer to the clarification question

State model:
Use this status model:

\`\`\`ts
type Status = "idle" | "scanning" | "done"
\`\`\`

Status labels:

\`\`\`ts
const LABELS: Record<Status, string> = {
  idle: "Scan",
  scanning: "Scanning",
  done: "Done",
}
\`\`\`

Stack:

* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Motion for React from \`motion/react\`

Use:

\`\`\`ts
import type { TargetAndTransition, Transition } from "motion/react"
import { AnimatePresence, motion, useReducedMotion } from "motion/react"
\`\`\`

Technical requirements:

* Make it a client component with \`"use client"\`.
* Use \`useState\` for scan status.
* Use \`useRef\` to store the scan completion timeout.
* Use \`useEffect\` cleanup to clear the timeout on unmount.
* Use \`useCallback\` for event handlers.
* Use \`useMemo\` for scan transitions.
* Use \`AnimatePresence\` to mount/unmount the scanning document.
* Use Motion keyframe arrays for document rotation and scan-bar movement.
* Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
* Keep the component self-contained and easy to paste into a Next.js or React app.

Do not use:

* GSAP
* canvas
* WebGL
* external animation libraries other than Motion
* JavaScript animation loops
* real OCR/scanning logic

Timing:
Use timing constants similar to:

\`\`\`ts
const SCAN_DURATION_MS = 5000
const SCAN_EXIT_DURATION_SECONDS = 0.4
const SCAN_ANIMATION_DURATION_SECONDS =
  SCAN_DURATION_MS / 1000 - SCAN_EXIT_DURATION_SECONDS
const SCAN_BAR_TRAVEL = 132
\`\`\`

Scan movement:
Use keyframe timing similar to:

\`\`\`ts
const SCAN_MOVE_TIMES = [0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.55, 0.9, 1]
const SCAN_CONTAINER_TIMES = [0, 0.55, 1]
\`\`\`

Document rotation:
The document should rotate around the Y axis in a full 360-degree cycle:

\`\`\`ts
const DOCUMENT_ROTATE_Y = [0, 0, 180, 180, 360, 360]
\`\`\`

Scan bar movement:
The scan bar should move from top to bottom, pause, then return:

\`\`\`ts
const SCAN_BAR_Y = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0].map(
  (progress) => progress * SCAN_BAR_TRAVEL
)
\`\`\`

Component structure:
Create these components:

1. \`ScanDocumentButton\`

* Owns the status state.
* Handles the scan click.
* Starts the timeout.
* Shows the scanning document only during the \`scanning\` state.
* Renders the button.
* Handles the selected reset/completion behavior.

2. \`ScanningDocument\`

* Renders the animated document.
* Uses \`motion.div\` for the entrance and exit.
* Uses a 3D perspective container.
* Rotates the document around the Y axis.
* Contains front and back faces.
* Contains two scan bars so the light stays visible during the 3D flip.

3. \`ScanBar\`

* Receives:

\`\`\`ts
type ScanBarProps = {
  transition: Transition
  z: number
}
\`\`\`

* Renders a glowing horizontal scan bar.
* Animates its vertical \`y\` position using the scan cycle transition.
* Uses orange gradients, glow shadows, and small blurred end caps.

4. \`Icon\`

* Inline scanner/crop-style SVG icon.
* Accepts:

\`\`\`ts
{
  size?: number
  color?: string
}
\`\`\`

Scanning document visual:

* Document size around \`110px x 150px\`.
* Parent should use:

\`\`\`tsx

\`\`\`

* Inner document should use:

\`\`\`tsx
"[transform-style:preserve-3d]"
\`\`\`

* Front face:

  * white
  * rounded
  * subtle shadow
  * fake document lines
  * small circle/avatar mark
  * signature-like mark near bottom
  * \`backface-visibility: hidden\`
* Back face:

  * zinc/gray
  * rotated with \`rotateY(180deg)\`
  * \`backface-visibility: hidden\`
* Add a thin spine-like vertical strip at the center to make the 3D flip feel more physical.

Scan bar visual:

* Width around \`124px\`.
* Height around \`7px\`.
* Rounded full.
* Orange gradient:

  * darker orange top/bottom
  * lighter orange center
* Add glow using box shadows.
* Add a thin white highlight line.
* Add blurred glowing dots on the left and right ends.

Button behavior:

* Button starts enabled in \`idle\`.
* Clicking only works when status is \`idle\`.
* During \`scanning\`, disable the button.
* During \`done\`, behavior depends on my selected completion/reset option.
* Button label and \`aria-label\` should use the current status label.

Button visual:

* Rounded-md button.
* Border with thicker bottom border.
* Scanner icon on the left.
* Label on the right.
* Use a tactile pressed-button style.
* Keep the styling easy to customize.

Layout:

* Render a section with:

\`\`\`tsx
<section aria-label="Document scanner">
\`\`\`

* Height around \`320px\`.
* Center content vertically and horizontally.
* Use a top visual area around \`170px\` tall for the scanning document.
* Place the button below the scan animation.
* Use \`AnimatePresence\` so the document exits cleanly.

Reduced motion:
Respect \`prefers-reduced-motion\`.

If reduced motion is enabled:

* avoid the full 3D rotateY cycle
* shorten the scan duration
* keep the status changes clear
* show a simpler scan indication or instantly transition to done after a short delay
* preserve the meaning of the interaction without long motion

Accessibility:

* Use a semantic \`button\`.
* Button should have an \`aria-label\` based on current status.
* Decorative scanning document should use \`aria-hidden="true"\`.
* Decorative icon paths should not create extra screen-reader noise.
* Disabled states should be visually clear.
* If a reset button is used, it must be keyboard accessible.
* Do not rely on animation alone to communicate completion; the button text should change to \`Done\`.

Expected usage:

\`\`\`tsx
<ScanDocumentButton />
\`\`\`

Return only after I answer the completion/reset clarification question:

1. Full \`ScanDocumentButton.tsx\` code.
2. The \`Status\` type.
3. \`ScanBar\` component.
4. \`ScanningDocument\` component.
5. \`Icon\` component.
6. Timing constants.
7. Motion transitions.
8. Timeout cleanup logic.
9. The selected completion/reset behavior.
10. Reduced-motion support.
11. Short customization notes for:

* scan duration
* scan bar color
* document size
* button styling
* done/reset behavior
* icon replacement
* 3D rotation intensity

Important:
Do not simplify this into a normal loading button. The key interaction is the physical document scan illusion: unfolding document, 3D rotateY flip, glowing scan bar travel, and final done state.`,

    prompt: `Create a reusable **Morphing Timer Picker** component for an existing React + TypeScript codebase.

Before writing any code, ask me which package manager I use and wait for my answer.

Then install the required wheel picker dependency using the matching command:

\`\`\`bash
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add @ncdai/wheel-picker
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
npx shadcn@latest add @ncdai/wheel-picker
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add @ncdai/wheel-picker
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @ncdai/wheel-picker
\`\`\`

Use the command that matches my package manager:

* Bun → \`bunx --bun shadcn@latest add @ncdai/wheel-picker\`
* npm → \`npx shadcn@latest add @ncdai/wheel-picker\`
* Yarn → \`yarn dlx shadcn@latest add @ncdai/wheel-picker\`
* pnpm → \`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @ncdai/wheel-picker\`

Do not start implementation until the wheel picker setup is confirmed.

Goal:
Build a polished morphing timer component that starts as a compact “Set timer” pill, expands into a minute wheel picker, and then morphs into a running timer surface with pause/resume, cancel, and a rounded-rectangle border progress indicator.

The component should feel like a high-quality native timer interaction: soft, dimensional, smooth, tactile, and portfolio-grade.

Component concept:

* Initial compact mode:

  * dark rounded pill
  * timer icon
  * label: \`Set timer\`
* Picker mode:

  * surface expands vertically and horizontally
  * wheel picker appears on the left
  * selected minute value is shown in a large iOS-style wheel
  * \`mins\` label appears beside the selected number
  * \`Start\` button appears on the right
* Running mode:

  * surface morphs into a wider timer panel
  * rounded-rectangle progress border traces the full container perimeter
  * remaining time is shown with tabular numbers
  * \`Pause\` button appears
  * \`Cancel\` button appears
* Paused mode:

  * timer stops counting down
  * \`Pause\` button label animates to \`Resume\`
  * progress border and remaining time stay frozen
* Cancel:

  * returns to compact mode
  * avoids flashing the progress border back to full during the exit transition

State model:
Use this mode model:

\`\`\`ts
type TimerMode = "compact" | "picker" | "running" | "paused"
\`\`\`

Stack:

* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Motion for React from \`motion/react\`
* \`@ncdai/react-wheel-picker\`
* \`cn()\` utility for class merging

Required imports:

\`\`\`ts
"use client"

import "@ncdai/react-wheel-picker/style.css"

import { useEffect, useRef, useState, type ComponentProps } from "react"
import { AnimatePresence, motion, useReducedMotion } from "motion/react"
import * as WheelPickerPrimitive from "@ncdai/react-wheel-picker"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
\`\`\`

Do not use:

* GSAP
* canvas
* WebGL
* date/time libraries
* external animation libraries other than Motion
* native \`<select>\`
* custom scroll physics from scratch

Main component name:

\`\`\`tsx
export const SetTimer = () => {
  return (...)
}
\`\`\`

Expected usage:

\`\`\`tsx
<SetTimer />
\`\`\`

Timer dimensions:
Define per-mode surface dimensions:

\`\`\`ts
const SURFACE_DIMENSIONS: Record<
  TimerMode,
  { width: number; height: number; borderRadius: number }
> = {
  compact: { width: 300, height: 84, borderRadius: 42 },
  picker: { width: 342, height: 286, borderRadius: 48 },
  running: { width: 390, height: 180, borderRadius: 48 },
  paused: { width: 390, height: 180, borderRadius: 48 },
}
\`\`\`

The main timer surface should animate:

* width
* height
* borderRadius
* opacity on entry

Use Motion spring transition:

\`\`\`ts
{ type: "spring", stiffness: 400, damping: 30, mass: 1.5 }
\`\`\`

Respect \`prefers-reduced-motion\`:

* use short duration transitions
* avoid excessive scaling
* preserve all state changes clearly

Minute options:
Create minute options from 1 to 60:

\`\`\`ts
const MIN_MINUTES = 1
const MAX_MINUTES = 60
\`\`\`

Each wheel picker option should contain:

* \`label\`
* \`value\`
* \`textValue\`

Use the wheel picker primitive types:

\`\`\`ts
type WheelPickerValue = WheelPickerPrimitive.WheelPickerValue
type WheelPickerOption<T extends WheelPickerValue = string> =
  WheelPickerPrimitive.WheelPickerOption<T>
\`\`\`

Wheel picker setup:
Create local wrappers around the primitive components:

1. \`WheelPickerWrapper\`

* wraps \`WheelPickerPrimitive.WheelPickerWrapper\`
* adds border, background, dark-mode styles, and rounded highlight edges

2. \`WheelPicker\`

* wraps \`WheelPickerPrimitive.WheelPicker\`
* customizes:

  * \`optionItem\`
  * \`highlightWrapper\`
  * \`highlightItem\`

Minute picker behavior:
Create a \`MinutePicker\` component with props:

\`\`\`ts
type MinutePickerProps = {
  selectedMinutes: number
  onChange: (minutes: number) => void
}
\`\`\`

Wheel picker configuration:

* \`infinite\`
* \`visibleCount={20}\`
* \`optionItemHeight={44}\`
* \`dragSensitivity={4}\`
* \`scrollSensitivity={10}\`

The selected item should be large, white, and tabular:

\`\`\`tsx
"text-[40px] font-normal leading-none text-white tabular-nums"
\`\`\`

Progressive blur:
Add progressive blur overlays above and below the picker center row.

Create a \`BlurLayer\` component with:

\`\`\`ts
{
  blur: number
  maskFrom: number
  maskTo: number
  side: "top" | "bottom"
}
\`\`\`

Use stacked \`backdrop-filter\` layers with masked bands:

* top blur layers:

  * blur 2px, mask 0–35
  * blur 4px, mask 30–65
  * blur 7px, mask 60–95
* bottom blur layers:

  * blur 2px, mask 0–35
  * blur 4px, mask 30–65
  * blur 7px, mask 60–95

Also add a vertical fade overlay at the extremes so the picker feels like a native wheel.

Content layers:
Create a reusable \`ContentLayer\` component:

\`\`\`ts
type ContentLayerProps = {
  children: React.ReactNode
  isVisible: boolean
  className?: string
}
\`\`\`

Behavior:

* All content layers are absolutely positioned.
* Visible layer:

  * opacity 1
  * scale 1
  * pointer events enabled
* Hidden layer:

  * opacity 0
  * scale 0.95
  * pointer events disabled
  * \`aria-hidden\`
  * \`inert\`

Use Motion transitions:

* visible enter: around 0.22s with slight delay
* exit: around 0.15s
* reduced motion: around 0.1s

Timer countdown logic:

* Store selected minutes in state.
* Store remaining seconds in state.
* Store deadline timestamp in a ref.
* Store total seconds in a ref.
* When running:

  * calculate remaining time from \`deadlineRef.current - Date.now()\`
  * update every 250ms
  * use \`Math.ceil\`
  * when remaining reaches 0:

    * clear deadline
    * return to picker mode

Use this formatter:

\`\`\`ts
const formatTime = (seconds: number) => {
  const minutes = Math.floor(seconds / 60)
  const remainingSeconds = seconds % 60

  return \`\${minutes}:\${remainingSeconds.toString().padStart(2, "0")}\`
}
\`\`\`

Handlers:
Implement:

* \`handleOpenPicker\`
* \`handleStart\`
* \`handlePauseResume\`
* \`handleCancel\`
* \`handleMinutesChange\`

Behavior details:

* \`handleOpenPicker\`

  * reset remaining seconds to selected minutes
  * switch to picker mode
* \`handleStart\`

  * set total seconds
  * set remaining seconds
  * set deadline
  * switch to running mode
* \`handlePauseResume\`

  * if running: clear deadline and switch to paused
  * if paused: create a new deadline from current remaining seconds and switch to running
* \`handleCancel\`

  * clear deadline
  * switch to compact
  * keep \`remainingSeconds\` unchanged during exit so progress border does not flash back to full
* \`handleMinutesChange\`

  * update selected minutes
  * update remaining seconds

Timer border:
Create a \`TimerBorder\` component with props:

\`\`\`ts
type TimerBorderProps = {
  remainingSeconds: number
  totalSeconds: number
  width: number
  height: number
  borderRadius: number
}
\`\`\`

The border should:

* trace the full rounded-rectangle perimeter
* start and end at the top center
* draw clockwise
* use a dark background stroke
* use a primary-colored animated progress stroke
* use \`pathLength={1}\`
* use \`strokeDasharray={1}\`
* animate \`strokeDashoffset\` to \`1 - progress\`

Progress formula:

\`\`\`ts
const progress = totalSeconds === 0 ? 0 : remainingSeconds / totalSeconds
\`\`\`

Use an explicit SVG path instead of \`<rect>\` so the dash origin starts at top center.

Button/content visual details:
Compact mode:

* dark surface
* full-size button
* timer icon on left
* large \`Set timer\` text
* focus-visible ring

Picker mode:

* wheel picker on left
* green \`Start\` button on right
* Start button has \`whileTap={{ scale: 0.96 }}\`

Running/paused mode:

* progress border behind content
* Pause/Resume button on left
* time in the middle/right with tabular numbers
* Cancel button on right
* Pause/Resume label should animate vertically using \`AnimatePresence\`

Pause/Resume label animation:
Use:

\`\`\`tsx
<AnimatePresence initial={false} mode="popLayout">
\`\`\`

The label should slide:

* initial: \`y: "100%", opacity: 0\`
* animate: \`y: "0%", opacity: 1\`
* exit: \`y: "-100%", opacity: 0\`

Timer icon:
Create an inline \`TimerIcon\` SVG.

* size around \`40px\`
* white fill
* partially transparent background circle
* no external icon dependency

Accessibility:

* Main surface should have:

\`\`\`tsx
aria-label="Timer"
\`\`\`

* Use real buttons for all interactions.
* Use focus-visible rings.
* Hidden content layers should use:

  * \`aria-hidden\`
  * \`inert\`
  * pointer-events disabled
* The wheel picker should remain keyboard/focus accessible through the primitive.
* Timer text should be readable and not rely only on the border progress.
* Do not trap focus.
* Reduced motion should preserve usability.

Layout:

* Outer container:

  * height around \`500px\`
  * full width
  * centered content
  * overflow hidden
  * light gray background \`#e9e9e9\`
* Timer surface:

  * relative
  * minimum width around \`250px\`
  * overflow hidden
  * background \`#2c2c2c\`
  * shadow-sm

Return:

1. Full \`SetTimer.tsx\` component.
2. Wheel picker setup/import instructions.
3. The package installation command for my package manager.
4. \`WheelPickerWrapper\`.
5. \`WheelPicker\`.
6. \`TimerMode\` type.
7. Minute options.
8. \`TimerIcon\`.
9. \`ContentLayer\`.
10. \`MinutePicker\`.
11. \`BlurLayer\`.
12. \`TimerBorder\`.
13. Timer countdown logic.
14. Pause/resume/cancel behavior.
15. Reduced-motion support.
16. Short customization notes for:

* default selected minutes
* min/max minutes
* wheel picker height
* surface dimensions
* border progress color
* timer duration behavior
* compact/picker/running labels
* dark/light theme styling

Important:
Do not simplify this into a normal timer form. The key interaction is the morphing surface: compact timer button → wheel picker → running timer with rounded-rectangle progress border.`,

    prompt: `Create a reusable **Timezone Showcase / World Clock Comparison Card** component for an existing React + TypeScript codebase.

Before writing any code, ask me these clarification questions and wait for my answer:

1. **Which package manager do you use?**

   * Bun
   * npm
   * Yarn
   * pnpm

2. **What should be the local/base timezone?**

   * Example: \`Asia/Kolkata\`

3. **Which cities/timezones should be shown?**

   * Example:

     * Jamshedpur — \`Asia/Kolkata\`
     * San Francisco — \`America/Los_Angeles\`
     * London — \`Europe/London\`
     * New York — \`America/New_York\`

4. **Should the card support dark mode?**

   * Yes, include light and dark mode styles.
   * No, keep it light-only.

Do not start implementation until I answer these questions.

Package setup:
This component requires Luxon for timezone-safe date/time handling.

After I tell you my package manager, install dependencies using the matching command:

\`\`\`bash
bun add luxon motion
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
npm install luxon motion
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
yarn add luxon motion
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
pnpm add luxon motion
\`\`\`

If TypeScript reports missing Luxon types, also install:

\`\`\`bash
bun add -d @types/luxon
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
npm install -D @types/luxon
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
yarn add -D @types/luxon
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
pnpm add -D @types/luxon
\`\`\`

Goal:
Build a polished world-clock comparison card that shows the user’s local time and multiple remote city times. The card should include an animated horizontal clock ruler, day/night status indicators, timezone offset labels, per-digit time animations, and an expandable list of additional cities.

The component should feel like a premium iOS-style world clock widget: precise, editorial, smooth, compact, and portfolio-grade.

Component concept:

* A rounded card displays a world clock comparison.
* The top area shows:

  * active timezone label
  * active offset difference
  * animated horizontal 12-hour ruler
  * centered orange marker
* The list area shows city rows:

  * offset label
  * city name
  * day/night status
  * current local time for that city
* Hovering or focusing a city row updates the active timezone/ruler.
* The ruler slides so the hovered city’s time aligns under the center marker.
* The first city is the local/base city.
* The card starts collapsed with two rows.
* A “See more” button expands the remaining rows.
* A “See less” button collapses the card again.

Stack:

* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Motion for React from \`motion/react\`
* Luxon
* \`cn()\` utility if needed

Required imports:

\`\`\`ts
import { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from "react"
import { DateTime } from "luxon"
import {
  AnimatePresence,
  animate,
  motion,
  useMotionValue,
  useReducedMotion,
} from "motion/react"
\`\`\`

Do not use:

* Date-fns
* Moment.js
* native \`Date\` timezone formatting for the core logic
* GSAP
* canvas
* WebGL
* external clock widgets
* JavaScript animation loops except the 1-second time update interval

Main component name:

\`\`\`tsx
export const TimezoneShowcase = () => {
  return (...)
}
\`\`\`

Expected usage:

\`\`\`tsx
<TimezoneShowcase />
\`\`\`

Types:
Create these types:

\`\`\`ts
type WorldClockRow = {
  city: string
  offset: string
  status: "day" | "night"
  time: string
  height: string
  timezoneLabel: string
  deltaLabel: string
  rulerTilt: number
  isLocal: boolean
}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`ts
type WorldClockLocation = {
  city: string
  zone: string
  height: string
  rulerTilt: number
  isLocal?: boolean
}
\`\`\`

Location data:
Create a configurable \`worldClockLocations\` array.

Example:

\`\`\`ts
const localZone = "Asia/Kolkata"

const worldClockLocations: WorldClockLocation[] = [
  {
    city: "Jamshedpur",
    zone: localZone,
    height: "h-[126px]",
    rulerTilt: 0,
    isLocal: true,
  },
  {
    city: "San Francisco",
    zone: "America/Los_Angeles",
    height: "h-[127px]",
    rulerTilt: -22,
  },
  {
    city: "London",
    zone: "Europe/London",
    height: "h-[126px]",
    rulerTilt: 18,
  },
  {
    city: "New York",
    zone: "America/New_York",
    height: "h-[121px]",
    rulerTilt: 24,
  },
]
\`\`\`

Timezone labels:
Create a label override map for zones that need custom labels:

\`\`\`ts
const timezoneLabelByZone: Record<string, string> = {
  "Asia/Kolkata": "IST",
}
\`\`\`

Create \`getTimezoneLabel(dateTime, zone)\`:

* Use configured label first.
* Otherwise use \`dateTime.offsetNameShort\`.
* If short name starts with \`GMT\`, fall back to \`dateTime.toFormat("ZZZZ")\`.

Offset difference:
Create \`formatOffsetDifference(targetOffsetMinutes, baseOffsetMinutes)\`:

* Compare target offset to base offset.
* Return \`+0H\` if same offset.
* Return values like:

  * \`-12:30H\`
  * \`-5:30H\`
  * \`+4H\`
  * \`+1H\`

Day/night status:
Create \`getStatus(dateTime)\`:

* Return \`day\` when hour is between 8 and 18.
* Return \`night\` otherwise.

Rows:
Create \`createWorldClockRows(now)\`:

* Convert \`now\` to each location’s zone.
* Format time as \`HH:mm\`.
* Calculate timezone label.
* Calculate offset delta against the base/local timezone.
* Mark local row as \`YOUR TIME\`.
* Return \`WorldClockRow[]\`.

Clock ruler:
Build a horizontal 12-hour ruler.

Use constants similar to:

\`\`\`ts
const RULER_SUB_SPACING = 7
const RULER_HOUR_WIDTH = RULER_SUB_SPACING * 12
const RULER_CYCLE_WIDTH = RULER_HOUR_WIDTH * 12
const RULER_HOUR_RANGE = 96
const RULER_VIEW_WIDTH = 690
const RULER_MARKER_X = RULER_VIEW_WIDTH / 2
const RULER_ANCHOR_CYCLE = RULER_CYCLE_WIDTH * 4
\`\`\`

Ruler behavior:

* Each hour is a major tick.
* Each hour has 11 minor ticks between it, representing 5-minute steps.
* The ruler should repeat across a large range so no strip ends are visible.
* The center marker should stay fixed.
* The ruler strip should move horizontally so the active city’s time lands under the center marker.
* When switching active city, animate the ruler toward the nearest wrapped position so it takes the shortest path around the 12-hour loop.

Create:

* \`toClockLabel(hourIndex)\`
* \`rulerHourTicks\`
* \`rulerMinorTicks\`
* \`timeToClockHours(time)\`

\`timeToClockHours\` should fold 24-hour time onto a 12-hour scale:

\`\`\`ts
const timeToClockHours = (time: string) => {
  const [hour, minute] = time.split(":").map(Number)
  return (hour % 12) + minute / 60
}
\`\`\`

Ruler animation:
Use \`useMotionValue\` for \`rulerX\`.

Use \`animate(rulerX, wrappedTarget, rulerSpring)\` where:

\`\`\`ts
const rulerSpring = {
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 70,
  damping: 12,
  mass: 1,
} as const
\`\`\`

If reduced motion is enabled, set the ruler position instantly.

Card scale:
The original design is tuned at around \`690px\` wide. Add a scale constant:

\`\`\`ts
const CARD_SCALE = 0.6
\`\`\`

Use CSS \`zoom\` instead of \`transform: scale\` for showcase cards because \`zoom\` reflows the layout box and avoids breaking Motion layout animations caused by ancestor transforms.

Card visual:

* Width around \`690px\`.
* Rounded corners around \`30px\`.
* Light background:

  * \`#F6F6F7\`
* Active surface:

  * \`#ECECEE\`
* Dark mode support:

  * card: \`#1B1F22\`
  * active surface: \`#1B1E22\`
  * rows: \`#24262B\`
* Subtle 1px shadow/border.
* Use \`overflow-clip\`.
* Use antialiased text.
* Use \`font-synthesis: none\`.

Card height:
Animate card height based on expanded state:

* collapsed: around \`486px\`
* expanded: around \`734px\`

Use a smooth collapse transition:

\`\`\`ts
const collapseTransition = {
  duration: 0.32,
  ease: [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1],
} as const
\`\`\`

Header:
At the top of the card, render:

* active timezone label on the left
* active delta label on the right

Both should animate on change using \`AnimatePresence\`:

* new label enters from below
* old label exits upward
* use slight blur during enter/exit

Ruler:
Render an SVG inside a masked horizontal container:

* width \`690px\`
* height \`70px\`
* mask edges with a left/right fade
* minor ticks are shorter/lighter
* major ticks are taller/darker
* hour labels sit above ticks
* centered orange marker is a vertical rounded line at the card center

Rows:
Create \`WorldClockListRow\`.

Props:

\`\`\`ts
{
  row: WorldClockRow
  index: number
  shouldReduceMotion: boolean
  handleHoveredTimezoneChange: (row: WorldClockRow | null) => void
}
\`\`\`

Each row should:

* be focusable with \`tabIndex={0}\`
* update active timezone on mouse enter/focus
* reset active timezone on mouse leave/blur
* have a full accessible label:

\`\`\`tsx
aria-label={\`\${row.city}, \${row.offset}, \${row.status}, \${row.time}\`}
\`\`\`

Row layout:

* fixed row height from row data
* bottom border
* local row uses active surface
* remote rows use normal row surface and hover surface
* left side:

  * offset label at top
  * city name below
* right side:

  * day/night status at top
  * time below

Typography:

* Offset/status labels:

  * mono font
  * uppercase feel
  * around \`20px\`
  * tracking around \`0.04em\`
* City names:

  * serif display font
  * around \`40px\`
* Time:

  * sans font
  * around \`42px\`
  * tabular numbers

Status indicator:
Create \`StatusIndicator\`.

If status is \`night\`:

* render \`NIGHT\`
* render a moon icon
* use muted gray text

If status is \`day\`:

* render \`DAY\`
* render a green dot
* add a soft green ring/shadow

Animate status icon changes with \`AnimatePresence\`.

Animated time:
Create \`AnimatedTime\`.

Behavior:

* If reduced motion is enabled, render plain text.
* Otherwise split the time string into characters.
* Animate each character with staggered children.
* Use tabular numbers.
* Only remount/replay when the full value changes by using \`key={value}\`.
* Use a small y/opacity/blur pop-in.

Variants:

\`\`\`ts
const digitVariants = {
  hidden: { y: 8, opacity: 0, filter: "blur(2px)" },
  visible: { y: 0, opacity: 1, filter: "blur(0px)" },
}
\`\`\`

Live time:
Use a 1-second interval:

* \`setNow(DateTime.now())\`
* cleanup interval on unmount

Expanded rows:

* Always show first two rows.
* Put remaining rows inside \`AnimatePresence\`.
* When expanded:

  * animate height from 0 to auto
  * opacity from 0 to 1
  * blur from 4px to 0
* When collapsed:

  * animate height back to 0
  * opacity to 0
  * blur to 4px

See more / See less button:

* Absolute footer area.
* Move footer top position depending on expanded state.
* Button text:

  * collapsed: \`See more\`
  * expanded: \`See less\`
* Include chevron icon.
* Use \`aria-expanded\`.
* Use \`aria-label\`:

  * \`See more world clock rows\`
  * \`See fewer world clock rows\`
* Rotate chevron depending on expanded state.
* Add hover/tap animation unless reduced motion is enabled.

Reduced motion:
Respect \`prefers-reduced-motion\`.

If reduced motion is enabled:

* disable entry blur movement
* set ruler position instantly
* render time values without per-digit animation
* avoid hover/tap scale effects
* keep expand/collapse readable with minimal opacity/height changes

Accessibility:

* Main section should use:

\`\`\`tsx
aria-label="World clock time comparison"
\`\`\`

* City rows should be keyboard focusable.
* Hover and focus should trigger the same active timezone behavior.
* Do not rely only on hover.
* Decorative SVG icons should use \`aria-hidden="true"\`.
* The expand button should use \`aria-expanded\`.
* The card should still make sense with animation disabled.

Dark mode:
If I choose dark mode support, include \`dark:\` Tailwind classes for:

* card background
* active surface
* row background
* row hover background
* borders
* primary text
* muted text
* ruler ticks
* ruler labels
* shadows

Return:

1. Full \`TimezoneShowcase.tsx\` component.
2. Luxon + Motion installation command for my package manager.
3. \`WorldClockRow\` and \`WorldClockLocation\` types.
4. Timezone/location configuration.
5. Time formatting helpers.
6. Offset difference helper.
7. Day/night status helper.
8. 12-hour ruler constants.
9. Ruler tick generation.
10. \`StatusIndicator\`.
11. \`AnimatedTime\`.
12. \`WorldClockListRow\`.
13. Expand/collapse logic.
14. Ruler hover/focus behavior.
15. Reduced-motion support.
16. Dark-mode support if selected.
17. Short customization notes for:

    * base timezone
    * city list
    * collapsed row count
    * card scale
    * ruler density
    * day/night threshold
    * typography
    * dark mode
    * animation intensity

Important:
Do not simplify this into a static list of clocks. The key interaction is the active timezone comparison system: live timezone calculations, hover/focus-driven active row, animated 12-hour ruler alignment, expandable rows, and animated time/status transitions.`,
